In my current capacity as the Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Dream Team Home Care Inc. for the past 12 years, I have successfully managed multiple properties and facilitated home purchases for many of my employees and friends. I possess extensive experience in mortgage processing, encompassing the collection and review of applications as well as the verification of essential documents to ensure the accuracy of information.

Furthermore, my responsibilities entail effective communication with prospective customers, adeptly resolving any problematic issues that may arise. I proactively contribute to the development and implementation of new processes and procedures, aimed at enhancing overall operational efficiency and reducing unnecessary expenses within the mortgage management domain.

In addition to my expertise in the mortgage industry, I also possess a background as a Cardiologist, bringing a strong attention to detail, exceptional critical thinking skills, and the ability to operate autonomously as well as within deadline-driven team environments. As the Head of the Financial Department at Dream Team, I am proficient in utilizing essential software programs, such as Unify CRM and QuickBooks, required for optimal job performance.

Moreover, as a native Sri Lankan speaker, I am fluent in English, Russian, Sinhalese, and some Tamil. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to arrange an in-person meeting to further discuss the position and elaborate on my qualifications.

Thank you for considering my application, and I eagerly await your response.

Sincerely,

Indika Ranpatabendi
